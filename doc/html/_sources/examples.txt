`Browse the Jupyter notebooks <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mforets/polyhedron_tools/tree/master/examples/>`_ which are available
in the ``/examples`` folder in this repository. 

These can be displayed in a window embedded in github, but it is recommended to use the
external `nbviewer <http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mforets/polyhedron_tools/tree/master/examples/>`_.
